just random stuff.

this repo is a dump for small things i build while learning or messing around.
some are ai-assisted, some are manual, most are not serious.

examples:
- browser extensions
- tiny backend experiments
- parsers, scripts, prototypes
- “what if i try this” code

nothing here is production ready.
if something grows big, it’ll move to its own repo.

structure will change.
things may break.
that’s fine.


stuff:

| name       | what it is? |

| GPTcontext | prompt context injection experiment - extension |
| asynq | background task queue with worker - using asynq - Golang |
| Sxrapie | extension to scrap every page you visit |
